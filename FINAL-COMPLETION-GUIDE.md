## 🧪 Verified Network Testing

The multi-peer P2P network has been **successfully tested and verified working**:

```
✅ Node1 starts on ports 3001 (HTTP) and 6001 (P2P)
✅ Node2 connects to Node1 automatically
✅ Bidirectional P2P communication established
✅ Blockchain synchronization working
✅ Peer discovery and handshake protocols working
✅ Network heartbeat and connection management working
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Build the project
npm run compile
npm run build

# Start a single node
npm run global-node

# Or start with custom ports
set HTTP_PORT=3001
set P2P_PORT=6001
npm run global-node
```

### 2. Multi-Node Network

```bash
# Start first node
set HTTP_PORT=3001
set P2P_PORT=6001
npm run global-node

# Start second node (connects to first)
set HTTP_PORT=3002
set P2P_PORT=6002
set SEED_NODES=ws://localhost:6001
npm run global-node
```

### 3. Production Deployment

```bash
# Using Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Manual deployment
npm run deploy:mainnet

# Cloud deployment (see GLOBAL-DEPLOYMENT.md)
```

## 🌍 Global Access

Once deployed, your HackCoin node is accessible globally:

- **Web Interface**: `http://YOUR_IP:3001`
- **API Endpoints**: `http://YOUR_IP:3001/api/*`
- **P2P Network**: `ws://YOUR_IP:6001`

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/blocks` | GET | Get blockchain |
| `/api/wallet` | GET | Get wallet info |
